Healthcare Chatbot with Medical PDF Processing

This project implements a powerful healthcare chatbot that leverages advanced techniques for information retrieval and text-based interaction. It's designed to:

Answer medical-related questions: Users can pose inquiries about various health topics, leveraging the knowledge base within the processed PDF documents.
Provide informative responses: The chatbot draws upon the extracted content and generates responses that detail symptoms, treatments, and disease descriptions.
Facilitate specialization-based appointment bookings: While not directly implemented in the provided code, the prompt template leaves room for future development to integrate appointment booking for specific healthcare specializations (dermatologist, cardiologist, etc.).
Key Functionalities:

PDF Processing: Extracts relevant text from medical PDFs using the PyPDFLoader class.
Text Chunking: Divides the extracted text into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, ensuring efficient processing.
Embedding Creation: Generates vector representations of the text chunks with the aid of a pre-trained Hugging Face model (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Pinecone Integration: Utilizes the Pinecone Vector Database to efficiently store and retrieve these embeddings.
Prompt Engineering: Defines a custom prompt template using PromptTemplate that guides the large language model (LLM) in generating informative responses.
RetrievalQA Model: Employs the RetrievalQA chain type to combine information retrieval and question answering capabilities.
Chat Model Configuration: Initializes a ChatGroq LLM model with the llama3-70b-8192 architecture, suitable for handling complex healthcare data.
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file and populate it with your API credentials (GROQ API key, Pinecone API key) following the structure shown in the code.
Customize data path: Modify the data_path variable in the load_pdf function to point to the directory containing your medical PDFs.
Run the script: Execute the Python script to initiate the chatbot.
Additional Considerations:

This is an illustrative example, and additional development might be necessary to refine the user interface and functionalities.
For real-world deployment, ensure you have the necessary permissions and agreements to process and store healthcare-related data.
Further Enhancement Ideas:

Explore alternative text chunking strategies to optimize processing efficiency.
Experiment with different LLM models and fine-tuning techniques to improve response accuracy and relevance.
Integrate a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
Implement the appointment booking functionality using appropriate APIs or services.
Consider security and privacy measures for handling sensitive health information.
By effectively combining document processing, vector embeddings, and a powerful LLM, this project lays the foundation for a valuable healthcare chatbot with the potential to enhance user knowledge and access to medical information.
